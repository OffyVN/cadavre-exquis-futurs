  "revised_prompt": "Imagine an image featuring a central human figure of Hispanic descent standing prominently. The shadows extended from the figure on the ground mysteriously split into four distinct separate silhouettes carrying out various jobs: farming, coding on a laptop, teaching, and building with tools. There are dotted lines intricately connecting these shadows, hinting at an interconnected network. Illustration should be in isometric view. The color palette should be deep petrol blue and orange, set amidst a cream-colored background. The style should lean towards retro-futuristic isometric illustration with clean lines and a vintage infographic feel. The image should appear as if it's printed on aged, textured off-white paper with a retro aesthetic. Design to fit portrait aspect ratio suitable for A5 card printing, with no text, words, letters, or numbers.",
