  "revised_prompt": "Generate an isometric illustration of a modern corporate building structure, possessing a unique foundation of massive, organic tree roots burrowing deep into the ground, forming a sturdy base. This structure displays elements of organic design throughout its architecture. It should reflect the color palette of terracotta/rust, cream, and muted green. Emphasize clean lines and a vintage infographic feel to confer a retro-futuristic look. The image, suitable for portrait aspect ratio, should mimic the appearance of being printed on aged, textured cream or off-white paper. Aim for an A5 card printing size, and make sure it includes no text, words, letters, or numbers.",
